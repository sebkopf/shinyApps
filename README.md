This repository is intended to hold the source code for different shiny apps used for research and educational purposes. Please use the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/sebkopf/shinyApps/issues) for any feedback, suggestions, bug reports, feature requests, etc.

## Available apps

 - [isolabel](https://github.com/sebkopf/shinyApps/tree/master/isolabel), an application demonstrating the dynamics of isotope labeling
 - [nirogen cycle dynamics](https://github.com/sebkopf/shinyApps/tree/master/nitrogen_cycle_dynamics) illustrating the isotope dynamics of the nitrogen cycle
 - [N2O data viewer](https://github.com/sebkopf/isorunN2O/tree/master/inst/shiny-apps/data_viewer#n2o-data-viewer), a web application for real time monitoring of N2O analysis via the denitrifier method as developed in the Sigman lab at Princeton University (Note: this application has been moved from this repository and is now integrated directly into the [isorunN2O package](https://github.com/sebkopf/isorunN2O))
